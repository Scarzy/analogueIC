\subsection{Step Response}

The design shows a step response that matches the input voltage fairly perfectly, providing zero observable overshoot.

The required settling time for this device is $\tau_{s} = 1.2\mu s$.
As can be observed in figure \ref{fig:ztep} the input changes at $12.5\mu s$.
$1.2\mu s$ after this is $13.7\mu s$.
It can be clearly seen that the output has settled by the $13.2\mu s$ mark, which is $0.5\mu s$ before its deadline, hence this part of the specification is met.

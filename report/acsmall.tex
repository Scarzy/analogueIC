\subsection{Small Signal}

Figure \ref{fig:Sac} shows a very interesting characteristic, it suggests an amplifier in which the gain and phase margins are practically frequency independant.
Although not shown here, this simulation was continued up to 10THz, and presented no observable change.
The only interesting aspect is with the first 1KHz, as shown in figure \ref{fig:Sac1K}.

\subsection{Small Signal}

Figure \ref{fig:Sac} shows the gain and phase at various common mode voltages.
It shows clearly that the DC gain of $60dB$ is met, it is still at approximately the same value at $100KHz$ and is therefore much greater than the required $26dB$.
The phase margin is considered in figure \ref{fig:SZac}.

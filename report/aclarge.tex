\subsection{Large AC Signal Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:Lac} shows the result of Large Signal AC analysis of the device.
The green line is the input signal, with the blue signal being the output.
As can be seen the buffer circuitry tracks the input pretty closely, losing a little bit of amplitude at the very peak of the waveform.
